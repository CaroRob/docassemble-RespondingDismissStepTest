  Before the court can enter a default judgment, ${ other_party_in_case } is supposed to give you copies of the court papers by process server or certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt.  If ${ other_party_in_case } did not, you may be able to challenge the default.

  Your situation is complicated. You may want to [talk to a lawyer](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/shclawyer.htm). If you do not respond to the Alaska case, the Alaska judge may enter a custody order. This could be very complicated if you already have a custody order in another state. It is best to file a Motion to Dismiss your Alaska case to tell the Alaska judge 
      % if proper_service:
        about the order from the other state

    % else:
  If the case in the other state is over and the other court issued final orders, you can file a **Motion to Dismiss** your Alaska case.

  File a copy of the final orders from the other state, and any other documents that support your request.
  % endif

  
  % if (type_of_response['improper service'] and not proper_service) or type_of_response['default']:
  If you do not have a copy of the filed documents, you can ask ${ other_party_in_case } or get a copy from your file at the courthouse. Read about [getting copies of your court file](https://courts.alaska.gov/trialcourts/index.htm#recs) on the court’s website.

        , and you want the court to dismiss the case, you can fill out and file a “Motion to Dismiss” that tells the court why you want to dismiss the case.

    Because the other parent asked for a default judgment, it is important to file your motion as soon as possible to prevent the judge entering a default judgment order.

      If the other parent asked for a default judgment, the judge may decide without hearing from you if you do not respond. You could end up with 2 different custody orders from 2 different states . To prevent this, file a **Motion to Dismiss** to tell the Alaska judge (1) about the other case and (2) that your children have not lived in Alaska for the last 6 months. Tell the judge in the other state about the Alaska case.

  Because the other parent asked for a default judgment, it is important to file your motion as soon as possible to prevent the judge entering a default judgment order.

  In the 1st section, write what you want the judge to order in your case.  For example, that you want the judge to dismiss the case.

  In the 2nd section, tell the judge why you think Alaska does not have jurisdiction over your children. 


  % if type_of_response['improper service'] or (type_of_response.any_true('improper service', 'default') and not proper_service):
  You can also tell the judge ${ other_party_in_case } did not serve you properly.
